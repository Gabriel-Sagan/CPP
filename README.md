CPP or Chord Progression Program creates a chord progression in a 32-bar form and can be used for real time improvization or as an analysis tool. 

## Installation and Setup:

CPP uses the Python libraries SCAMP and music21. Type the following commands in the command prompt to install: 

pip install scamp music21

CPP requires a music XML reader. Music notation software such as Sibelius, Finale, or MuseScore work fine. MuseScore is free and recommended: https://musescore.org/en/download

## Run the app:

Open cpp0.7.py, configure file path, run cpp0.7.py and open outputted XML file with XML reader of choice.
