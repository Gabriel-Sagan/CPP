CPP or Chord Progression Program creates a chord progression in a 32-bar form and can be used for real time improvization or as an exercise in analysis. 

## Installation and Setup:

CPP uses the Python libraries SCAMP and music21. Type the following commands in the command prompt to install: 

pip install scamp music21

CPP requires a music XML reader. Music notation software such as Sibelius, Finale, or MuseScore work fine. MuseScore is free and recommended: https://musescore.org/en/download

## Run the app:

Open cpp0.7.py, configure file path, run cpp0.7.py, and configure input for music21 library using configure.run() command on line 45 (only needs to be ran once and can be removed after setup is complete).
